MACHINE_LEARNING_ASSIGNMENT_1

- ASSUMPTIONS:
I assumed that in exercise 2.4 the idea was to plot the whole regression again,
but with the test values instead of the train values. The test error that we are
expected to compute is shown above each chart in an identical fashion as in exercise
2.3.

- ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IN EXERCISE 2.5:

I think that since the training and the test data stem from the same set of values
and are actually very similar, a low value of k such as 3 better represents the 
regression. Many points of the training data are located where the test data should
approximately be located, so I think that k = 3 is a good fit, since it captures
the nearest 3 neighbors. If the value increases, the curve flattens and the prediction starts
becoming less precise.
