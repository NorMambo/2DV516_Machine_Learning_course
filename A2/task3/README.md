6) Repeated runs will (due to the shuffling) give different results.
Are they qualitatively the same? Do they depend on how many observations you put aside for testing? 
Is the difference between training and testing expected?

Once more than 50% of the data is set as training data, the training errors amount to more than the testing errors.
When the train data is less than 50% of the total data, the testing errors amount to more than the training errors.
Which means that the results depend on how much is set aside for testing. A difference is expected.

The accuracy shows that train and test sets perform almost always similarly, even in extreme cases, such as When
5% of the data is set aside for training and 95% for testing. The difference is always around 1 to 3 percentage points
between training and testing accuracy.
