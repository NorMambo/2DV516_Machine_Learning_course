EXERCISE 4)

ANSWER TO THE QUESTION:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was expecting a higher accuracy with the forest method (majority vote), because i think that 100 differently trained classifiers with good
parameters should be able to provide a very good estimation of the outcome. I was not surprised by the forest method's accuracy.

Another reason why I expected that outcome was because the accuracy of every single tree is almost always higher than 95 %.
Which means that when you pass a single value to all all of the classifiers and then do the majority vote, it is likely that you're
going to get a good result.

I think that this is one of the most interesting prediction methods that I've seen so far. I don't see many downsides to it.
I believe it's a very efficient algorithm that allows to predict data with multiple lables or binary lables.
